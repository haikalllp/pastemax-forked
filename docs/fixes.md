# Fixes and Improvements

This document outlines the key fixes and improvements implemented to address issues with `.gitignore` handling, binary file detection, and performance when loading large repositories.

## Path Handling Standardization

### Problem
- Inconsistent path handling across the application
- Different normalization strategies led to mismatch in path comparisons
- Platform-specific issues (Windows, Mac and Unix) caused incorrect gitignore pattern matching

### Solution
- Created a shared path utilities module in `shared/path-utils.js` with TypeScript definitions
- Standardized path functions to work consistently across Node.js and browser environments
- Implemented robust handling of Windows and Unix paths
- Added explicit macOS detection and compatibility logic
- Enhanced handling of macOS-specific paths (app bundles, resource forks)
- Addressed macOS filesystem case sensitivity variations
- Removed duplicate implementations of path functions

### Impact
- Consistent path normalization throughout the application
- Cross-platform compatibility for path operations
- More reliable path comparisons for `.gitignore` pattern matching
- Proper handling of macOS-specific path formats

## `.gitignore` Handling

### Problem
- Files specified in `.gitignore` not being properly ignored
- Default ignore patterns inconsistently applied
- Performance issues when scanning large repositories

### Solution
- Centralized default ignore patterns in `excluded-files.js`
- Improved `.gitignore` loading with better caching
- Enhanced pattern matching with normalized paths
- Added early checks for common patterns before expensive `.gitignore` processing
- Ensured consistent handling across Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Impact
- Correctly identifies and ignores files as specified in `.gitignore`
- Better performance through optimized pattern checking
- More consistent application of ignore patterns

## Binary File Detection

### Problem
- Binary files incorrectly tagged or processed
- Slow detection mechanism causing performance issues
- Inconsistent handling across the application

### Solution
- Enhanced binary file detection with centralized binary extension list
- Improved the `isBinaryFile` function to be more reliable
- Added early binary file check in file reading process

### Impact
- Binary files are now correctly tagged rather than excluded entirely
- Improved UI experience when browsing repositories with binary files
- Reduced processing load when working with binary files

## Performance Optimization

### Problem
- Program becomes slow and unresponsive when loading large repositories
- Excessive processing of files that should be ignored
- High memory usage when traversing large directories

### Solution
- Added a `SKIP_DIRS` constant for directories that should be completely skipped
- Implemented the `shouldSkipDirectory` function to efficiently bypass problematic directories
- Added early checking of exclusion patterns before deeper processing
- Enhanced directory traversal with chunked processing and progress reporting

### Impact
- Dramatically improved performance when loading large repositories
- Reduced memory consumption during directory traversal
- More responsive UI during file loading operations
- Proper handling of edge cases like `node_modules` directories

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Problem
- Different behavior between Windows, Mac and Unix-based systems
- Inconsistent handling of path separators and case sensitivity
- Platform-specific edge cases not properly addressed

### Solution
- Implemented platform detection in the shared path utilities
- Added special handling for Windows-specific path quirks
- Improved macOS compatibility through:
  - Explicit macOS platform detection (`isMac` flag)
  - Special handling for macOS `.app` bundles and package structures
  - Support for macOS resource fork paths (`..namedfork`)
  - Addressing macOS case sensitivity variations (HFS+, APFS)
- Created cross-platform tests to ensure consistent behavior

### Impact
- Consistent application behavior across different operating systems
- Reliable path matching regardless of platform
- Better user experience on all supported platforms
- Proper handling of platform-specific path formats

## Code Organization and Maintainability

### Problem
- Duplicate code for path handling and file operations
- Inconsistent patterns across the codebase
- Difficult to maintain and extend

### Solution
- Refactored common functionality into shared modules
- Created TypeScript definitions for better type safety
- Added comprehensive tests for critical components
- Improved documentation and code comments

### Impact
- More maintainable codebase with less duplication
- Easier to extend with new features
- Better developer experience with improved type safety
- Clearer code organization
