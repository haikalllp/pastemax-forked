# PasteMax Updates

## v1.3.0 | 2024-03-21

## Overview
This document outlines the application hardening and security improvements made to the PasteMax application, with a focus on production-ready builds and cross-platform security.

More details on [update.md](docs/update.md)

## 1. Application Security Hardening

### Production-Specific Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented a comprehensive Content Security Policy with different configurations for development and production
- Added dynamic nonce generation using the crypto module for script-src directives in production
- Production CSP now features:
  - Strict default-src policy limiting resources to same origin ('self')
  - Nonce-based script-src validation to prevent XSS attacks
  - Restricted connect-src to prevent data exfiltration
  - object-src 'none' to prevent plugin-based attacks
  - base-uri and form-action restrictions to prevent redirects
  - frame-ancestors 'self' to prevent clickjacking
  - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS upgrades with upgrade-insecure-requests
- Added enhanced security headers:
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

### Browser Window Security Enhancements
- Implemented environment-specific security settings:
  - Disabled DevTools in production builds
  - Enabled sandbox mode in production for renderer process isolation
  - Enforced same-origin policy with webSecurity: true
- Added proper window navigation protection:
  - Blocked navigation to non-local content
  - Implemented window open handler to control external links
  - Forced external URLs to open in the default browser

### Runtime Security Controls
- Added protection against malicious navigation:
  - Monitoring and blocking of will-navigate events to external sites
  - Strict protocol checking for allowed destinations
  - Proper external URL handling through electron.shell.openExternal
- Implemented proper event unregistration to prevent memory leaks
- Added comprehensive error logging for security-relevant events

## 2. macOS Build Hardening

### Build Directory Structure and Purpose
- Created dedicated `build` directory to house platform-specific build configuration files
- Purpose of the directory:
  - Centralized location for build-time configuration files
  - Separation of build concerns from application code
  - Storage for platform-specific security requirements
  - Integration point with electron-builder packaging system
- Configuration is automatically detected and used by electron-builder during packaging
- Directory is excluded from tokenization and file processing through ignoreFilter

### Entitlements for macOS Security
- Created build/entitlements.mac.plist for proper App Store compliance and security
- Implemented sandboxing with com.apple.security.app-sandbox
- Configured file access permissions:
  - Limited read-only access to user-selected files
  - Controlled read-write access to specific user-selected files
- Added hardened runtime entitlements:
  - JIT compilation support with appropriate restrictions
  - Controlled executable memory permissions
  - Inheritance of security settings from parent process

### Configuration for Production Builds
- Set up production environment flags to enable security features automatically
- Added conditional security settings based on NODE_ENV=production
- Enhanced error handling and reporting for production environments
- Implemented graceful degradation for improved reliability

## 3. Development Environment Improvements

### Development Mode Configurations
- Created specific development CSP that allows:
  - HMR (Hot Module Replacement) functionality with websocket connections
  - Vite development server connections
  - Appropriate 'unsafe-eval' permissions only in development
- Added clear console logging to distinguish between development and production mode
- Implemented automatic suppression of development-specific warnings

### Cross-Platform Path Handling
- Enhanced path normalization for consistent behavior across platforms
- Improved handling of Windows UNC paths and drive letters
- Added safe path joining functions to prevent path traversal issues
- Implemented better relative path calculation for cross-platform compatibility

## 4. Build Process Security

### Safe Module Loading
- Added robust error handling for module loading failures
- Implemented fallbacks for critical dependencies
- Added comprehensive logging of module loading status
- Created defensive coding patterns to handle missing or incompatible modules

### File Handling Security
- Added validation of file paths before processing
- Implemented size limits for file reading to prevent DoS attacks
- Added proper binary file detection and handling
- Enhanced directory traversal protection with path validation

## 5. CSS and Styling Improvements

### Enhanced CSS Documentation
- Completely restructured CSS documentation with standardized section headers
- Added a detailed table of contents with hierarchical organization:
  - 10 main sections with clear subsection breakdowns
  - Each component type grouped under appropriate categories
- Added extensive inline documentation:
  - Purpose description for every component
  - Explanation of property choices and behavior
  - Cross-browser compatibility notes
  - Theme-specific variations
- Enhanced code organization:
  - Logically grouped related styles together
  - Standardized comment format for better navigation
  - Added visual separator blocks for major sections
  - Documented relationships between interacting components

### Theme System Improvements
- Added detailed documentation for theme variables:
  - Organized variables into logical categories (backgrounds, typography, feedback colors)
  - Added descriptive comments for each color variable explaining its purpose
  - Documented specific color choices for design consistency
- Enhanced dark mode implementation:
  - Added explicit dark mode documentation
  - Improved contrast ratios for better accessibility
  - Documented component-specific dark mode adjustments

### Component Styling Consistency
- Standardized styling patterns across similar components:
  - Consistent spacing and sizing
  - Uniform hover and focus states
  - Standardized animation timings
- Documented reusable utility classes and patterns
- Added explicit browser support notes for cross-platform features

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing ASAR archive encryption for additional protection
- Investigate Electron's contextBridge for more secure IPC
- Review and enhance application auto-update security
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit of all application components
