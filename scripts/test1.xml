# Mechvibes: A fun and practical way to bring your favorite keyboard sounds anywhere

> Mechvibes started as a side project I created for myself. Like many mechanical keyboard lovers, I faced challenges when using my keyboard in quiet environments - whether it was late at night or in the office. The loud, satisfying clicks might be music to my ears, but not so much for my parents or coworkers! If you‚Äôre in the same boat, Mechvibes is here for you.
