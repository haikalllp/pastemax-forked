# Technical Stack and Development Standards

## Core Technologies
- Electron-based desktop application
- Backend: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Frontend: TypeScript + React
- Build System: Electron Builder

## Architecture Overview
- Main Process (Backend)
  - JavaScript-based core functionality
  - Node.js native modules integration
  - IPC communication handling
  - System-level operations

- Renderer Process (Frontend)
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - React for UI components
  - State management (specify your preferred solution)
  - Modern ES6+ features

## Development Environment
- Separate development and production configurations
- Development entry: `dev.js`
- Production build: `build.js`
- Environment-specific variables in respective config files
- Hot-reload support for development

## Code Organization
- Modular architecture
- Maximum file size: 200-300 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based directory structure
- Shared utilities and components

## Testing Framework
- Unit tests for all new features
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Test coverage requirements
- Testing utilities and helpers
- Mocking strategies

## Build and Deployment
- Manual build process oversight
- Environment-specific builds
- Code signing and packaging
- Release management
- Update distribution

## Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- Code review requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## Development Workflow
- Feature branch workflow
- Code review process
- Testing requirements
- Documentation updates
- Manual build verification

## Performance Considerations
- Memory management
- IPC communication optimization
- Resource loading strategies
- Caching mechanisms
- Bundle size optimization
