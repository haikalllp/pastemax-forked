# Development Guidelines and Preservation Rules

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Preserve current UI design patterns unless explicitly requested for changes
- Maintain consistent user experience across all features
- Follow existing design system and component patterns
- Ensure accessibility standards are maintained

## Code Architecture
- Preserve existing functionality and logic unless improvements are required
- Integrate new features seamlessly with current implementation
- Follow modular design principles
- Maintain separation of concerns

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure cross-compatibility between Windows, Linux, and Mac
- Focus on path normalization using platform-agnostic approaches
- Use path utilities from `utils/*` or `shared/*` modules
- Test functionality across different operating systems

## Debugging and Logging
- Implement comprehensive debugging and logging for critical code paths
- Use console logging for development debugging
- Add informative error messages and stack traces
- Structure logs for easy troubleshooting

## Testing Strategy
- Create unit tests after implementation is stable
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) when appropriate
- Ensure test coverage for critical functionality
- Include edge cases and error scenarios in tests

## Documentation
- Document all new implementations in markdown
- Track progress in `docs/*` directory
- Create new documentation files when needed
- Include:
  - Feature overview
  - Implementation details
  - Usage examples
  - Dependencies
  - Testing procedures

## Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic
- Document breaking changes
- Update relevant documentation with code changes

## Code Quality
- Follow established code style and formatting
- Keep functions and methods focused and concise
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Final Checklist
- Verify all tests pass
- Confirm cross-platform compatibility
- Update documentation
- Document implementation details in chat
- Review code for potential improvements
